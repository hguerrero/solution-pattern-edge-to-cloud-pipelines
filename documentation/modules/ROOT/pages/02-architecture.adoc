Introduction for the architecture of this solution pattern.

== Common Challenges 

To better explain and detail the reasons for the existence of this solution pattern we’ll picture some common needs and challenges amongst organizations that already have production systems and seeks innovation and modernization.

AI/ML production deployment is an iterative process that goes beyond simply generating AI/ML models or even ML Ops.

The primary milestones in the AI/ML life cycle depending on an organization's business goals for its AI/ML effort are as follows:

- Collect and prepare the data needed for your AI/ML project. It is critical to be astute in terms of what functions take place at the edge. We do not want to do compute or storage intensive operations at the Edge, but rather should use the core or cloud.
What we should concentrate on at the edge is data collecting and data inference, where you will use AIML to make real-time decisions.
- Create ML models based on business objectives. MLOps should take place on the core or in the cloud to retrain models as needed.
- Integrate the ML models with the intelligent applications that you will create to serve the model and assist in making critical business choices.
- Model accuracy should be monitored and managed throughout time.

As organizations continue to grapple with massive amounts of data being generated from sources ranging from device edge to off-site facilities and public and private cloud environments, data managers are encountering a new challenge: how to properly ingest and process that data to receive actionable intelligence in a timely manner.

With fresh, relevant data, businesses can learn effectively and adapt to changing customer behavior. However, managing vast amounts of ingested data  and preparing to make that data ready as soon as possible—preferably in real time—for analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), is extremely challenging for data engineers.

[#in_depth]
== An in-depth look at the solution's architecture

Ingesting and preparing data can help organizations deploy automated data pipelines in an event-driven architecture. Continuous data, such as sensor metrics, temperature, and vibrations can be imported directly into an Apache Kafka topic in AMQ Streams.

=== Data Acquisition

Ingesting data into a distributed architecture allows data engineers to create pipelines that can help automate workflows and business processes.

- *Discrete data:* Images, video, and records are input as objects into an object bucket. 
- *Multiprotocol:* Data can be acquire using different protocols. Databases can connect to Kafka through a Debezium connector.

Data can be enhanced for an enriched data discovery experience, and it can be modified at various stages of the data pipeline life cycle as required by the use case.

- *Enhancement:* Objects can be enhanced with multifaceted metadata to make data discovery easier for search, analytics, and AI/ML workloads.
- *Modification:* Objects can be modified by AI tools. For example, an image may be anonymized to obscure sensitive data.

See below an abstract representation of the stage:

.Data Acquisition Overview.

=== Data Preparation & Modeling

One way to manage the flow of objects into the data pipeline is to create notifications that initiate a workflow. 

- *Object bucket:* Object bucket notifications can be pushed to various endpoints, such as Kafka, HTML, or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
- *Notifications:* As objects enter, exit, or are modified in the bucket, a bucket notification is made to a Kafka broker in Red Hat AMQ.
Change data capture: Red Hat Integration tools initiate processes like data replication and microservices integration through CDC.

=== Application Development & Delivery

Data moves through the pipeline and can trigger events. As the data is analyzed, it may trigger additional events creating an automated event-driven workflow.

=== Edge ML Inference

Data moves through the pipeline and can trigger events. As the data is analyzed, it may trigger additional events creating an automated event-driven workflow.

- *Eventing:* Whether discrete data has been pushed to a Kafka topic or continuous data is sent directly to the Kafka broker, the Kafka producer will call a service that writes to a Kafka topic and initiates an event. 
- *Elasticity:* Red Hat OpenShift Serverless can receive these event triggers and spawn multiple applications such as inferencing, alerts, messaging, anonymization, and preventative remediation. 
- *Edge to core:* Kafka can also mirror data from edge locations to a core repository for further processing.
Life cycle: Prioritized data can be moved back into a data repository for ML retraining, constituting a continuous improvement pipeline.
